    <!-- About Us Section -->
    <div class="section" id="about">
        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>We are <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreas-bayer-7101323/">Andreas Bayer</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stewarthauser/">Stewart Hauser</a>, seasoned startup veterans with decades of experience leading successful companies in Silicon Valley and beyond. We provide expert technology and finance guidance to help startups achieve their full potential—whether it’s gaining traction, overcoming challenges, or scaling rapidly.</p>

        <p>Andreas was Co-Founder & CTO at Beam Solutions (acquired by Jumio) and held senior engineering leadership positions at PayPal and MuleSoft (acquired by Salesforce for $6.5B). Stewart led Finance and other functions including Legal and Operations at Chariot (acquired by Ford) and Beam Solutions (acquired by Jumio).</p>
        
        <p>What sets us apart is the power of a cohesive CTO/CFO team. Having worked together on multiple ventures, we deliver seamless collaboration across technology and finance—two critical pillars of any startup’s success. Instead of hiring separate fractional executives and navigating potential misalignment, you gain a unified partnership that ensures your tech strategy and financial planning are perfectly aligned to drive sustainable growth.</p>
        
        <p>With a proven track record of driving growth, solving complex problems, and leading successful exits, we offer a unique blend of strategic vision and hands-on expertise to help your business thrive.</p>
